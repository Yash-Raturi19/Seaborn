# Seaborn

📊 Seaborn Data Visualization Project

Created a data visualization project using Seaborn to explore datasets and uncover meaningful patterns through clean, statistical visuals.

🔹 Used count plots, bar plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, KDE plots, and heatmaps
🔹 Visualized distributions, correlations, and category-wise trends
🔹 Focused on clear storytelling and insight-driven analysis

This project strengthened my EDA and data visualization skills, helping turn raw data into actionable insights.
